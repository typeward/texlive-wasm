/**
 * tex-packages.json — content-addressed manifest of TL files.
 *
 * Generated at engine build time by `scripts/build-manifest.ts` by walking the
 * built TDS tree. Distributed alongside the engine artifacts.
 *
 * The runtime uses this for three things:
 *   1. Decide which backend tier should serve a given TDS path.
 *   2. Verify bytes before they reach the engine. What that covers, exactly:
 *      the core bundle is checked as a whole against `coreBundleSha256` before
 *      it is unpacked (vfs/bundlefs.ts), and every file served out of the OPFS
 *      cache or fetched from the CDN is checked against its `files[].sha256`
 *      (withIntegrity + FetchFsOptions.verify in vfs/index.ts). Files inside
 *      an already-verified bundle are NOT re-hashed one by one, and a file the
 *      manifest does not list passes through unchecked — the manifest indexes
 *      the TL tree, it is not an allowlist for everything an app may mount. A
 *      backend the caller supplies itself (TauriFS, a custom `vfs` chain) is
 *      the caller's to verify; `withIntegrity()` is exported for that.
 *   3. Reverse-lookup which CTAN package a TDS file belongs to (used in error
 *      messages: "missing geometry.sty — try downloading the 'geometry' package").
