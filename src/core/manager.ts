/**
 * Engine lifecycle manager: lazy, memoized handles with an LRU cap.
 *
 * Every engine worker holds its own copy of the TDS in memory (the map it
 * drains at init plus the materialization during runs), so keeping all seven
 * engines alive is expensive — on mobile WebViews it is fatal. The manager
 * keeps at most `maxLiveEngines` workers alive, evicting the least-recently-
 * used idle one before creating the next, and awaiting its disposal so the
 * old and new engine never hold their trees at the same time.
 *
 * "Idle" means nothing is using the engine: handles are pinned for the
 * duration of every run() and for the whole of a `withEngines()` scope, so a
 * compile can never have its engine — or a helper it is about to need —
 * evicted underneath it. When everything is pinned the cap is exceeded rather
 * than deadlocking: a latexmk pipeline legitimately needs tex + bibtex +
 * makeindex + xdvipdfmx alive together, and blocking it to satisfy a memory
 * cap would hang the compile instead of slowing it.
